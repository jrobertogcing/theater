Test José Roberto González Castañeda

Theater Class created with 3 functions =)

// a : available

// h : hold

// r : held reserved


1- Know how many seats are available at the moment
2- Know which are the best places to buy. Setting in "hold" - "h" just for a period of time ( 5 seconds. count =5 in this case). Is going to choose the seats available at the front. Returning an object with the seats that were automatically chosen.
3- Reserve a seat on the theater. Returning a string with the number of tickets and setting the seat in "reserver"- "r". So this seat can't be chouse for the next automatic assignment, because is no longer available.
